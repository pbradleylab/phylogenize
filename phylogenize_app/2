			<span id="infotitle">Purpose</span>

      This web tool allows you to associate microbial prevalence (or
      specificity for a given environment) with individual microbial genes,
      starting from microbial relative abundances and sample labels. The method
      is described in
      <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/22/189795">
        Bradley, Nayfach, and Pollard (2018)</a>.<p>

			<span id="infotitle">Input</span>
      This tool requires two tab-delimited tables. The first is an OTU or
      species table of relative abundances, with microbes in rows and samples
      in columns. The second is a table of metadata, where samples are rows and
      the columns give environment and dataset labels. These can be labeled any
      way you choose. Environments usually give the location of the sample
      (e.g., human skin), but can also refer to healthy vs. disease in a
      case-control study. If you are calculating prevalence, you can also
      provide multiple dataset labels to combine information over multiple
      experiments. These experiments will then be weighted equally when
      calculating prevalence. An example relative abundance file can be found
      <a href="bodysite-averaged.tab">here</a>, and an example metadata file
      can be found <a href="bodysite-metadata.tab">here</a>.<p>

			<span id="infotitle">OTU/species table options</span>
      The OTU/species table can either be generated by applying MIDAS to
      metagenomic data or by applying DADA2 to 16S data. If uploading 16S data,
      you should first use the DADA2 package to make species level assignments
      based on the PATRIC database. To do so, simply download the PATRIC <a
        href="ftp://ftp.patricbrc.org/16s_RNA/16s_RNA_PATRIC.frn.gz">16S FASTA
        file</a> and use it with the <tt>assignSpecies()</tt> function
      (see the DADA2 <a href="https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html">
      tutorial</a>, under "Assign taxonomy"; we use <tt>assignSpecies()</tt>
      instead of <tt>assignTaxonomy()</tt> to take advantage of exact matching).
      Write the output to a tab-delimited file and upload it as the "DADA2
      mapping file" below. If using MIDAS, row names should be MIDAS IDs. Be
      sure to select the appropriate database.<p>
      
      <span id="infotitle">Phenotype</span>
      You can find associations either with prevalence, how commonly a
      particular microbe is observed in a given environment, or with
      environmental specificity, a measure of how predictive a given microbe is
      for an environment. The environment you are interested in should be
      entered under the "which environment" heading, exactly as it appears in
      the metadata file. (If you like, you can also skip this step and provide
      your own phenotype, such as drug resistance.) Power users can also
      control how likely each environment should be a priori by selecting an
      "environmental prior type" or uploading their own priors.<p>
