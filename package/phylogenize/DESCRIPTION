Description: phylogenize contains functions to estimate microbial prevalence and specificity scores from data, to associate these quantitative phenotypes with gene presence/absence (using the implementation of phylogenetic regression from the package phylolm), and to visualize the results. Both shotgun metagenomics and 16S amplicon data can be used with this pipeline.
